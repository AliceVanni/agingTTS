# Frysk Aging TTS
The current repository contains all the information about the installation and use of the TTS system I developed as part of my Thesis Project for the MSc Voice Technology.

The implementation is based on the pipeline developed for [ChildTTS](https://github.com/C3Imaging/ChildTTS). Unlike ChildTTS, the current TTS system uses FastSpeech2, following the [PyThorch implementation](https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2).

Python version used: Python 3.9.6
