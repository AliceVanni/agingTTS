# Frysk Aging TTS
The current ropository contains all the information about the installation and use of the TTS system I developed as part of my Thesis Project for the MSc Voice Technology.

The implementation is based on the pipeline developed for [ChildTTS](https://github.com/C3Imaging/ChildTTS) and it is implemented following [CorentinJ](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) code.

Python version used: Python 3.9.6
